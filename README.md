# crawler_CompanyAnnualReport
This is a very simple crawler program that throws exceptions and continues to perform. it can find 60-70% (if ideally) of the company's annual report.(after all, my demand is only such a point, maybe there will be updates later, 2333) 
At the moment I am reading data from excel and have a path to place the downloaded file. This is the parameter what you need to change. This program is not stable, nor can you guarantee that you can get all the data, so you better still have to look at the results of their own right or wrong .
I Analysis of these websites ("金融界", "东方财富网", "东方财富网股吧") which can probably get the annual report from, and get the pdf link,then download it. As for error, throw it_(:з"∠)_,(because i'm a rookie)
