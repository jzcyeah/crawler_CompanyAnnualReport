# crawler_CompanyAnnualReport
This is a very simple crawler program that throws an exception and continues to perform, finding 70-80% (if ideally) of the company's annual report. 
At the moment I am reading data from excel and have a path to place the downloaded file. This is the parameter what you need to change. This program is not stable, nor can you guarantee that you can get all the data, so you better still have to look at the results of their own right or wrong (after all, my demand is only such a point, maybe there will be updates later, 2333).
Probably from the "financial sector", "Eastern Fortune Network", "Eastern Fortune Net shares it" these can get the annual report of the website, and a little analysis of the pdf link, and then down. As for error, throw it_(:ли"Рѕа)_
